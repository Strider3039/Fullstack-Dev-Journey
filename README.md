# Fullstack-Dev-Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my journey to becoming a **full-stack developer**, containing:

- **Tutorials** I’m following step by step (based on the work of [@gitdagray](https://github.com/gitdagray))
- **Projects** I build to apply what I’ve learned
- A clear progression through major learning milestones

---

## Repository Structure

- Each tutorial is grouped by the **technology or tool** it focuses on  
  --> Located in: `tutorials/<tool-name>/`

- Projects I’ve completed along the way are separated into their own folder  
  --> Located in: `projects/<project-name>/`

---

## Goal

To keep all the code I write, whether it's from tutorials or personal projects, in one organized monorepo that showcases my learning progress and development over time.
